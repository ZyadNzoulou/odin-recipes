    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

        <li>Minced meat steaks</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Hamburger Buns</li>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Toast your buns using some butter 
        </li>
        <li>When the buns get that crunchy golden texture, place
            them in a small bag and seal them (it helps preserve the crunchiness!)
        </li>
        <li>Add some butter and cook your steaks</li>
        <li>When the steaks are cooked, remove your buns from their bag</li>
        <li>On the top bun, add ketchup and mustard (we recommend
            a 3:1 ketchup to mustard ration).
        </li>
        <li>And voil√†, you can close you can assemble your cheeseburger
            however you want, by adding small diced onions (and don't forget the cheese!)
        </li>
   </ol>
