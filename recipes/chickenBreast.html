        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice your chicken in half (your chicken should 
            look like a butterfly
        </li>
        <li>Season your chicken (on both sides) using paprika, salt,
            and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Turn on your stove to high heat</li>
        <li>Place butter in your pan</li>
        <li>When it's hot place your chicken breast and let
            it fry for a 1-2 minutes, repeat the process for the other 
            side.
        </li>
        <li>When both sides get that brown look, reduce your stove to medium heat and add a 
            small amount of water. Let it cook for a good 5-7 minutes.
            (If all the water evaporates, add some water back).
        </li>
        <li>When it's all done, place in a plate and let it cool
            for 2-3 minutes and then enjoy!
        </li>
   </ol>
